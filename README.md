The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

# Problem Statement

1. To reduce dimensions either using PCA or TSNE to compare the perfomance

2. To create clusters that detect human behavior using kmeans clustering and hierchichal clustering and compare the perfomance of the two.

# Perform Data Cleaning

1. Removed missing values

2. Dropped duplicates

3. Made the column names to be uniform

4. Kept the outliers to dicover the reasons as to why they exist

# Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  

Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analsis and found relationships between
 
   bouncerates and exitrates

    productrelated and productrelated_duration

    informational and informational_duration

    administrative and administrative_duration

# Implement the Solution
 
 Perfomed KMeans clustering
 
 Perfomed hierachichal Clustering
 
 Compared the perfomance between Kmeans and hierachical clustering
 
 Perfomed principal component analysis technique
 
 Perfomed TSNE reduction technique
 
 Compared the perfomance between PCA and TSNE reduction technique
 
 # Conclusion
 
 Choosing the most optimal dimension reduction technique and most optimal clustering technique.
